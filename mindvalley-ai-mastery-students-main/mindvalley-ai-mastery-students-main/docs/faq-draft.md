# Hattie B's Hot Chicken - FAQ Draft

## FAQ: Heat Levels

**Q: What heat levels do you offer and which one should I try first?**

A: We offer six heat levels: Southern (no heat), Mild, Medium, Hot, Damn Hot, and Shut the Cluck Up. If you're new to Nashville hot chicken, we recommend starting with Medium - it has great flavor with a manageable kick. You can always go hotter next time!

## FAQ: Ordering

**Q: Do you take reservations or is it first-come, first-served?**

A: We do not take reservations - it's first-come, first-served at all locations. The wait is part of the experience! Pro tip: weekday lunches typically have shorter wait times than weekend dinners.

## FAQ: Dietary

**Q: Do you have any gluten-free or vegetarian options?**

A: Our sides like coleslaw, baked beans, and banana pudding are vegetarian-friendly. For gluten-free guests, our chicken is naturally gluten-free (we use no breading), but it is cooked in shared fryers. Please inform our staff of any allergies when ordering.
