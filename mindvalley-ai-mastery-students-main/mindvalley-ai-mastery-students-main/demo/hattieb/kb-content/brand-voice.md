We've got water for folks in line, and our team is working as fast as we can while keeping quality high. Thanks for sticking with us!"

**❌ BAD**:
> "Everyone has to wait. If you don't like it, you can try somewhere else or order online."

### Scenario 3: Customer Has Gluten Allergy

**✅ GOOD**:
> "Absolutely, we can help! We have several gluten-free options including grilled tenders and our 'naked' fried chicken - that's fried without the breading. Many of our sides are gluten-free too, and they're marked on the menu. For serious allergies, we have special prep protocols to minimize cross-contamination. Just let our staff know and we'll take extra care with your order!"

**❌ BAD**:
> "We have some gluten-free stuff. Not sure what exactly. The menu should say."
